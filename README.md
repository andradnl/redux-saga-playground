1. What is Redux Saga? <br>
    *Redux Saga is a JS library built on top of Redux, which handles asynchronous operations like data fetching.*
1. What are Redux Saga effects? <br>
    *Effects or effect creators are functions you can execute as part of a Redux Saga control flow, which return plain JavaScript objects and trigger side effects. They do not perform any action, but instead instruct the middleware how to execute a given action.*
1. What are declarative effects? <br>
*Declarative effects are objects yielded within the saga by calling effect creators. These objects contain the description of an action that is to be executed by the middleware.*
1. What are some examples of effect creators? <br>
*Some commonly used effect creators are `call`, `put`, `apply`, `fork`, `take`, `takeLatest`, `takeEvery`, `takeLeading` etc.*
1. How can actions be dispatched to the Redux store? <br>
*Actions can be dispatched to the store using the `put` effect creator, called with an object containing the action type and its payload.*
1. What are blocking and non-blocking effects? <br>
*Blocking calls happen when a saga yields an effect and then waits for its outcome to resolve before resuming the execution of the generator. Non-blocking calls, on the other hand, donâ€™t stop the execution.*
1. How can errors be handled within a saga? <br>
*We can catch errors inside a saga using `try/catch` or adjust the API service to return an error based on which we can dispatch a specific action. A last resort for handling unexpected errors that propagate to the root saga is using the `onError` hook.*
1. What are saga helpers? <br>
*Saga helper effects spawn tasks when specific actions are dispatched to the Redux store. Helper functions are high level functions built on top of lower level functions such as `take` and `fork`.*
1. What are the most common helper functions? <br>
*The most common helper functions are `takeEvery` and `takeLatest`. `takeEvery` starts a new task on each dispatched action, while `takeLatest` cancels any pending (not completed) task started previously.*
1. How does `take` work? <br>
*`take` creates an effect description that instructs the middleware to wait for a specified action to be dispatched to the store. It is a blocking call. The result of `yield take(pattern)` is the action object being dispatched.*
1. What patterns can `take` be called with? <br>
*`take` can be called with no arguments or `*`, in which case all dispatched actions will be matched. Take can also be called with a function, a string or an array.*
1. What is the `END` action? <br>
*The `END` action is a special action provided by the middleware, which when dispatched, terminates all sagas blocked on a `take` effect. If a saga was terminated this way but it still had some forked tasks still running, it would wait for all its child tasks to terminate.*
1. How does takeMaybe work? <br>
*`takeMaybe` functions the same as `take`, but it does not automatically terminate the saga on an `END` action.*
1. How do `take` and `takeMaybe` work when called with a channel? <br>
*`take` and `takeMaybe` work the same when called with a channel as they do when called with a pattern. The difference is in what the middleware is instructed to wait for. When called with a pattern, the middleware waits for specific actions. When called with a channel, the middleware waits for a specified message from the provided channel. If that channel is already closed, the generator will terminate immediately, following the same process described above.*
1. What are channels? <br>
*Channels are objects used to send and receive messages between tasks. Messages from senders are queued until an interested receiver requests a message, and registered receivers are queued until a message is available for them. Every channel has an underlying buffer.*
1. How does `takeEvery` work? <br>
*`takeEvery` spawns a new saga either on each action dispatched to the store that matches the pattern parameter it is called with, or on each specified message from a given channel parameter. `takeEvery` allows for concurrent actions to be handled, but doesnâ€™t handle out of order responses from tasks. There is no guarantee that the tasks will be terminated in the same order they were started.*
1. How does `takeLatest` work? <br>
*`takeLatest` spawns a saga either on each action dispatched to the store matching the given pattern, or on each specified message from a given channel, automatically cancelling any ongoing saga tasks previously started.*
1. How does `takeLeading` work? <br>
*`takeLeading` spawns a saga either on each action dispatched to the store matching the given pattern, or on each specified message from a given channel, but blocks the newly spawned task until it completes, and only after that starts listening for another pattern or channel message again. As such, it is a blocking effect.*
1. How does `put` work? <br>
*`put` creates a non-blocking effect description that instructs the middleware to schedule the dispatching of an action to the store. `put` can be called with either an action parameter, or both a channel and an action parameter. When called with a channel and an action, it will instruct the middleware to put an action into the provided channel.*
1. How does `putResolve` work? <br>
*`putResolve` works the same as `put`, but the created effect is blocking.*
1. How does `call` work? <br>
*`call` creates an effect description that instructs the middleware to call the function passed as first parameter, with the arguments passed as second parameter. `call` also supports passing a `this` context to the function to be called, which is useful for invoking object methods.*
1. What is `apply`? <br>
*`apply` is an alias for `call`.*
1. What is the forking model in Redux Saga? <br>
*The forking model represents the two possible ways of dynamically instantiating sagas that can run in parallel: attached and detached. Attached forks use the `fork` effect creator, and remain attached to their parents. Furthermore, attached forks share the same semantics with the parallel effect (`all`), in the sense that the parent will terminate after all launched tasks finish their execution. Detached forks use the `spawn` effect creator and live in their own execution context, not attached to their parents.*
1. What is `fork` and how does it work? <br>
*`fork` is an effect creator that creates an effect which instructs the middleware to invoke a given (normal or generator) function in a non-blocking manner. The generator resumes as soon as the given function is invoked. Fork is relevant in the management of concurrency between different sagas. Yielding a `fork` effect creator returns a `task` object attached to its parent, whose termination the parent will wait for, even after its own body of instructions has finished executing.*
1. What is the difference between `call` and `fork`? <br>
*`call` is blocking, `fork` is non-blocking.*
1. How does error propagation work with forked tasks? <br>
*Errors from child tasks automatically bubble up to their parents. If any forked task raises an uncaught error, then the parent task will abort with the child `Error`, and the whole parent's execution tree (both forked tasks and main task if it's still running) will be cancelled.*
1. What is `spawn` and how does it work? <br>
*`spawn` is an effect creator that creates a detached forked task. A detached task and its parent are completely independent.*
1. What is `join` and how does it work? <br>
*`join` is an effect creator that creates an effect which instructs the middleware to wait for the result of a previously forked task. It will resolve with the same outcome as the joined task.*
1. What is `cancel` and how does it work? <br>
*`cancel` creates an effect description that instructs the middleware to cancel a previously forked task.*
